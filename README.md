creating a watson chatbot using IBM watson services for a flower shop

# Do's and Don'ts
In terms of a good chatbot design there are three fundamental rules that you should follow

**First Rule**

Avoid using **YES** or **NO** in your replies

If your chatbot fails to interpret the question, a **yes** or **no** answer would be 
misleading or provide wrong information.

**For example:**

We might set the reply for a question that asks for 

```
Q. Is delivery free?
A. Yes! it is
```

But what happens when the question is changed slightly

```
Q. Is delivery free or do I have to pay for it?
A. Yes! it is
```

The same answer won't work here. This situation arrived because of the negatives included 
in the question, where a human would answer **no** our chatbhot ends up answering **yes**

It would be far better to provide an answer that covers the topic of delivery price, 
without including an element of **yes** or **no** in it.

**Correct Reply**

```
Q. Is delivery free or do I have to pay for it?
A. Deliveries are free.
```

**Second Rule**

**Incorporate part of user's question in your response whenever possible**

For example, say 

```
A. "I understand that youâ€™re looking for help with an order.
	Unfortunately, I'm unable to look into orders that have already been placed."
```
And then perhaps we would have the chatbot refer the customer to our phone number or
email address, in order to help them perhaps speak with a live person about their concern.
This will further cement, in our user's mind, the relative intelligence of our chatbot,
even though it technically failed to directly provide what the customer was hoping to find
out.

**Third Rule**

**Succinct and accurate answers are the best**

This means we want to be informative but not reply with a wall of text. So we should keep 
our answers short. When a wall of text is an absolute must, to convey the information,then 
deflecting by sending the user to an informative page is a better approach.

# Creating Watson Chatbot
1. **Register** with Watson Assistant by clicking on this link.

2. **Verify your account** by clicking the confirmation email you receive by email (be 
sure to check your spam folder, if you don't see the email).

3. **Log in to IBM Cloud** (which hosts the Watson Assistant service) and when prompted, 
chose a cloud region and create an organization and space. US-South will work for many, 
but you have the option to select other cities and countries. For the organization, you 
can use your company name or even your own name. For space, pick a namespace that makes 
sense to you. For example, it can be a department in your organization (e.g., marketing) 
or a phase of development (test, dev, staging, or prod). You'll be able to customize and 
add new regions, organizations, and spaces at any time, so don't worry too much about 
what you select at first.

4. **Click on the Assistant service** within the Watson portion of the IBM Cloud 
catalog. 
This will bring you to a service creation page where you'll be asked to enter a name for 
the service. You can enter whatever you like or simply **watson-assistant-flower-shop**
Select the Lite plan that offers you up to 10,000 requests per month for free and click 
on **Create** Click on the Launch tool to launch the Watson Assistant user interface.

5. **Click on the workspace** to create any workspace or click on the existing one, and 
explore the example chatbot. What intents and entities are there? If you are adventurous 
you can even take a look at the dialog section. Play around with the default example in 
Watson Assistant and when you feel like you have become more familiar with it, go back 
to the workspaces list by clicking on the table icon in the left side of the page.

# Creating Workspace
Once we have our watson assistant ready, go to the workspace page again and click on
**Create Workspace** You will be asked for a name, I named it ```Florence Chatbot```
then enter the description for my case I used 

```
Flower Shop Chatbot for providing assistance in flower suggestions and delivery 
information.
```

Choose your preferred language for chatbot and **Create**.

The redirected page opened says to **Create Intents** because our chatbot currently has
no intents defined. On the top right corner click on **Try it out**, this is where you
can test your chatbot after each progress. You can enter in any message to chatbot.

Let's enter ```hello``` and we have no response and the bar under our message is also
empty, the bar will display the intent of the message.

# Create Intent
On the Intent page click on **Add Intent** and a form appears, name your intent 
```greetings``` and add in description like ```greet the user``` and in the 
```Add user examples``` add the examples of greetings.

For example

```
hello
hi
hey
hey there
what's up
how you doing
good morning
good evening
greetings
nice to see you
...
```

You can add as many intents you like based on many ways a user might greet our bot.
Once added intents you might see that ```Try it out``` says ```Watson is training```

That meas our Watson assistant is training and once that message goes we can test our 
chatbot by sending user examples we have set as well as any related random messages
we haven't trained our bot with.

Once message is entered our chatbot should identify the intent of the message and 
display it under the message

The same way create intents for ```#thank_you``` and ```#goodbyes```

**NOTICE** how I wrote ```thank_you``` because intent name cannot have spaces in it

Since we are making a chatbot assistant for a flower shop we would need more
intents than just ```greetings``` and ```goodbyes```

**Create** intents for ```#flower_suggestions``` and ```#delivery_info``` 

If a user asks for flower suggestions or flower recommendations then 
```#flower_suggestions``` intent will be avoked and if asks for delivery information
the ```#delivery_info``` intent will be activated

Some user examples are

**#flower_suggestions**
```
bouquet for girlfriend
flower recommendations
flowers for anniverseries
flowers for a yound lady
flowers for friend
flowers for judges
flowers for marriage function
flowers for my aunt
flowers for my uncle

flowers for your father
flowers for your mother
flowers for your soulmate
flower suggestions
glowers for anniverseries
I'd like to buy some flowers for a sick friend

...
```

**#delivery_info**
```
Do you deliver
do you deliver during holidays
do you deliver on weekends
how do i get my flowers
how much is delivery expenses
how much time in delivery
how will you deliver
is delivery free
what do ou deliver
when do you deliver
when will I get my delivery
when will i get my flowers
when will i receive my flowers
when will you deliver
will i be able to get my flowers on sundays
...
```

There can be lots and lots more of user examples and even mistakes in spelling from
the user side so the **more the examples better the assistant** gets trained.

# Importing Entities
We can actually create a csv file which then can be imported to our watson assistant.
In **Entities** section hover on the first arrow just after the Entities button,
it should say something for ```import```

Click on the import button and you will find the format of csv file for importing 
entities. Create a file like that and then choose the file from your computer

Entities will be imported and watson will be trained with them. Don't forget to check 
chatbot after training each time.

# Creating Dialogs
In the dialogs section of our chatbot tool you should see that two dialogs ```welcome```
and ```anything_else``` nodes are already there for us with default values

If you try out the chatbot again you should see a welcome response from the chatbot.
We will make this response more relating to our florence shop so click on the 
```welcome``` node and in the ```Then respond with:``` section enter your preferred text
for welcoming, the text should be very limited to the scope of our chatbot and should not include all the features that our chatbot supports, a nice welcome message would be

```
Hello. My name is Florence and I am a chatbot. How can I help you? You can ask me about 
flower suggestions or delivery information.
```

Now try out the chatbot again and it welcomes us with the new message.

If you type in Hello to the chatbot it doesn't respond with anything but we have our 
intent for greeting ready with lots of examples. So for greeting intent to take action
we need to create a dialog node for greeting.

1. Click on **Add node**
2. Name your node for e.g. **Greeting**
3. In **If bot recognizes:** portion enter the entity name
	```
	If bot recognizes:
	#grettings
	```
4. Next enter the response
	```
	Then respond with:
	Hi I am here to help you. Feel free to ask me for flower recommendations or delivery information.
	```
5. Close by clicking on cross and try out the chatbot again

Similarly create dialog nodes for **Thank You** but be sure to put your nodes above
**anything_else** node, you can move your nodes by clicking on the three dots

Once we have our nodes ready we can jump onto more advanced chit-chat dialog flow.
If a user asks about flower suggestions for his father our chatbot will recognize
the entity but won't respond. For that we have to make a parent node which handles
flower suggestions and then child nodes from it which responds to 
```@relationship:father``` and we need to make our parent node jump to the child node
using the options given at end of node.
 
For recommending same flowers to more than one relationship we can use ```and```
```or``` responses

For more relationships create more child nodes with same name 
```Relationship Suggestion``` and change the condition to the whichever relation 
you are pointing to and add response accordingly

# Integrating Watson Chatbot Into Python
So far we have been making a watson chatbot, there is a lot more that can be improved in
our chatbot but we will proceed with that later. In this section we will use the watson
[python-sdk](https://console.bluemix.net/docs/services/conversation/develop-app.html#building-a-client-application) to communicate with our chatbot using python

In ```client_app.py``` we have some imports at the top

```
import os
import watson_developer_cloud

from dotenv import load_dotenv, find_dotenv
```

You might be very well aware with ```os``` module but the other two modules need to be 
installed using pip (or any other source)

```
pip install --upgrade watson-developer-cloud
```

watson-developer-cloud is the python package to handle the watson python integration.

```
pip install python-dotenv
```

dotenv package in python is used to handle the ```.env``` file and the env variables inside 
the file, if you have worked with django you should be aware of the env variables.

Create a ```.env``` file and ```.gitignore``` file if not exists in the main folder and 
add ```.env``` in ```.gitignore```

Your ```.env``` file should have

```
WATSON_USERNAME=YOUR USERNAME
WATSON_PASSWORD=YOUR PASSWORD
WATSON_WORKSPACEID=YOUR WORKSPACE ID
WATSON_VERSION=YOUR VERSION
```

Put your credentials from the ```menu > deploy``` in the **watson chatbot tool**

In the [docs](https://console.bluemix.net/docs/services/conversation/develop-app.html#building-a-client-application) for python watson client application you can find this in more detail.

Once you have your env file ready you can use the variables with **watson_developer_cloud**

**client_app.py**
```
import os
import watson_developer_cloud

from dotenv import load_dotenv, find_dotenv

load_dotenv(find_dotenv())

service = watson_developer_cloud.AssistantV1(
	username=os.getenv("WATSON_USERNAME"),
	password=os.getenv("WATSON_PASSWORD"),
	version=os.getenv("WATSON_VERSION")
)

workspace_id = os.getenv("WATSON_WORKSPACEID")
```

Notice we import two methods from ```dotenv``` (python-dotenv) package namely 
```load_dotenv``` and ```find_dotenv```

```load_dotenv``` will load the env variables from the path specified and ```find_dotenv``` 
will locate the ```.env``` file from the folder in which the python file is located. We have
our .env file in the path as our python file, hence we have successfully loaded our env 
variables.

Now ```os``` module comes in handy, it gives us the variable values from their keys

**NOTE:** Your env variables should not conflict with the existing system (Computer) 
variables.

## Communicating With Watson

**client_app.py**
```
# Start conversation with an empty message
response = service.message(
	workspace_id=workspace_id,
	input={
		'text': ''
	}
).get_result()

```

We use the ```service``` to send a message to our chatbot which is contained inside the 
```input``` dict with ```'text': ''``` and at last we need to use the ```get_result()```
method on the repsonse message so that it is converted into a json serializable object

Now simply print the ```response``` and run the file and you should find long json data.

Analyze the json data and print out the useful information like the input and output text

```

print(f"USER: {response['input']['text']}")
print(f"WATSON: {response['output']['text'][0]}")
```

Run the file again and you should get the specific information.
